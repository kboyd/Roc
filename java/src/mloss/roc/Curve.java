// TODO: handle case where classifier output is a weak ranking, e.g. class labels

/**
 * <p>This class is a binary classification result analysis suitable for
 * producing ROC and PR curves.  It represents a ranking from which ROC
 * and PR curves are computed.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Brief Background: Classification</h3>
 *
 * <p>A binary (positive-negative) classifier assigns some number (a
 * score or probability or class label) to each data point (example) in
 * a data set.  The assigned number reflects the classifier's belief
 * that the example is truly a positive example (as opposed to a
 * negative example).  Each example also has a true label, its class.
 * Therefore, to test a classifier, one uses it to classify unseen
 * examples (a test set) and compares those classification results with
 * the true labels.</p>
 *
 * <p>To classify new examples, one must first choose a threshold.
 * Then, all the examples with scores higher than the threshold are
 * classified positive and all other examples are classified negative.
 * In practice, considering only a single threshold is restrictive.  ROC
 * and PR curves consider performance at all possible thresholds.  To do
 * that, the scores are ranked from most-believed positive to
 * most-believed negative and then the list of true labels in the ranked
 * order is analyzed to produce ROC and PR curves.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more information consult the Wikipedia pages on <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification">binary
 * classification</a>, <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">ROC
 * analysis</a>, <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">PR
 * analysis</a>, and your favorite book on machine learning.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>This is the central class for creating and working with ROC and PR
 * curves.</p>
 *
 * <p>To create a ROC or PR curve, one only needs the ranking of true
 * labels from most positive to most negative.  This is because the
 * scores become immaterial after ranking: the number of labels assigned
 * correctly can be counted for any threshold in the ranking, regardless
 * of any scores.  (After choosing a threshold between two labels, all
 * examples above the threshold are classified positive and all others
 * below are negative.)  Once the ranking is obtained, one can use it to
 * compute curves, areas, statistics, etc.  That is what this class
 * does.  It holds a ranking and uses it to compute curves and other
 * information.</p>
 *
 * <p>One can construct this class directly from a ranking of labels,
 * but it is more convenient to use a builder to compute the ranking and
 * construct this class.  There are two builders.  The regular {@link
 * Curve.Builder} accepts collections of objects and the {@link
 * Curve.PrimitivesBuilder} accepts arrays of primitive numbers.  (You
 * can use the class {@link mloss.roc.util.IterableArray} to treat
 * arrays of objects as iterable collections suitable for the regular
 * builder.)  You give a builder a list of scores (from your classifier)
 * and a corresponding list of labels and the builder does the rest.
 * See the <a href="{@docRoot}/overview-summary.html">overview</a> for a
 * code example.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Technical Details</h3>
 *
 * <p>Conceptually a ROC or PR curve is a list of confusion matrices,
 * one for each possible threshold of a ranking.  This representation
 * contains all the information needed to compute everything about ROC
 * and PR curves.  If you have n points in your ranking, you need n + 1
 * confusion matrices, one between each element of the ranking and one
 * on each of the ends.  A confusion matrix is a 2-by-2 table describing
 * the classification result that would occur if one chose the
 * classification threshold after the current element of the ranking.  A
 * confusion matrix contains four numbers: the number of true positives,
 * the number of false positives, the number of false negatives, and the
 * number of true negatives.  See the following table.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *            |              Actual               |
 * Classified | Positive        | Negative        |
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Positive   | True Positive   | False Positive  |
 * Negative   | False Negative  | True Negative   |
 * ------------------------------------------------
 *            | Total Positives | Total Negatives |
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Although each confusion matrix involves four numbers, each can
 * actually be represented by two numbers plus two totals (shared among
 * all matrices): the number of true positives so far in the ranking,
 * the number of false positives (negatives) so far in the ranking, the
 * total number of positives in the ranking, and the total number of
 * negatives in the ranking.  This is possible because the following
 * identities allow one to recover each confusion matrix.</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * true positives = (true positive counts list)[ranking index]
 * false positives = (false positive counts list)[ranking index]
 * false negatives = (total positives) - (true positives)
 * true negatives = (total negatives) - (false positives)
 * </code></pre>

         * statistic for the negative examples.  Thus we need to know
         * both statistics, or at least which is which, not just the
         * minimum one.
         *
         * The individual U statistics are not necessarily integers, so
         * we need to return a pair of doubles.
         *
         * The ranking of the labels has to be reconstructed from the
         * counts so that the U statistics can be calculated.  The

         * sum up the ranks for the positive and negative labels, but
         * tied labels get a fractional, mean rank.  The mean rank is
         * just the mean of all the "raw" ranks of the labels that are
         * tied.  So if labels with "raw" ranks of 2, 3, 4, 5 are tied
         * they each get a fractional rank of 3.5.  In order to
         * calculate the rank each label gets, we need to know the
         * minimum and maximum "raw" ranks of the group, or,
         * alternatively, the maximum "raw" rank and the numbers of
         * positives and negatives in the group.  (All labels in a group
         * are tied and correspond to a single confusion matrix.)  The
         * mean rank is calculated as (((min-raw-rank) + (max-raw-rank))
         * / 2).  The quantity (min-raw-rank) is the same as the
         * ((max-raw-rank) + 1) from the previous group/confusion matrix
         * and can therefore be calculated as ((max-raw-rank) -
         * (pos-count) - (neg-count) + 1).
         *
         * The formula for an individual U statistic is
         *
         * u = r - n * (n + 1) / 2
         *
         * where r is the sum of fractional ranks for the sample and n
         * is the sample size.  Relationships between the U statistics

         * N = n1 + n2

     * <p>Builds {@code Curve} objects in multiple, flexible ways.  The
     * methods in this class independently specify each piece of
     * requisite information and can be chained together into a single,
     * self-documenting expression.  (This class is a <a
     * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent
     * interface</a> <a
     * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">builder
     * pattern</a>.)</p>
     *
     * <p>This builder works with iterable sequences of objects.  To
     * build a Curve from arrays of primitive numbers see {@link
     * PrimitivesBuilder}.<p>
     *
     * <p>Fundamentally, a curve is built from a ranking of labels and a
     * label to consider positive.  This approach is "pure" but often
     * inconvenient (see {@link Curve#Curve(List, Object)}).  Therefore,
     * curves are often constructed from lists of predictions (scores)
     * and the corresponding actual labels, which are typically
     * conveniently available.  In this case, the actual labels are
     * ranked by sorting the scores in descending order.<p>
     *
     * <p>Thus, in order to build a curve one must provide (1) a ranking
     * of labels or (2) corresponding lists of predictions and actual
     * labels.  A positive label must also be provided in either case.
     * (This class allows arbitrary labels for flexibility, such as
     * easily handling multiclass tasks, but then the user must say what
     * label is positive in a given situation.)</p>
     *
     * <p>There are also additional options.  A list of weights may be
     * given.  The list of weights must correspond to the lists of
     * predicteds and actuals (if given) or correspond to the list of
     * ranked labels.  A comparator may be given which will be used for
     * sorting the scores.  Otherwise the natural ordering of the scores
     * will be used.<p>
