<p>Roc is software for generating and working with ROC and PR curves.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC)</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">precision-recall
(PR)</a> curves are typically used to evaluate supervised classification
approaches in areas such as Machine Learning and Epidemiology.
Scientists and researchers are the target audience of this software.</p>

<p>This is the Java version of the software.  The Java version is a
library that provides an API for computing ROC and PR curves and their
statistics.  (See the Python version for a command line utility that
includes plotting.)  This library is intended to be used with Java 5 or
later.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We assume you are reasonably familiar with ROC and/or PR curves and
the basics of supervised classification before using this software.  If
not, consult your favorite text or online source on machine learning or
statistics.</p>

<p>The <strong>general idea</strong> is that accuracy is an inadequate
measure of classification performance because it describes a single
point in a space of trade-offs.  A better evaluation would describe the
whole space.  Indeed, this is what ROC and PR curves do.  They describe
how performance varies as trade-offs vary.  In ROC space, the trade-off
is between true positives and false positives, and in PR space the
trade-off is between precision and recall.  While not a perfect
evaluation of classification performance, these curves provide a much
more thorough view than accuracy alone.  Still, people often desire a
single summary number and so report the area under the curve.</p>

<p>A <strong>ROC curve</strong> describes the true positive rate as a
function of the false positive rate across all choices of a
classification threshold.  ROC curves go from (0,0) to (1,1) and are
monotone increasing.  Better ROC curves approach the point (0,1) and
have larger areas.  The ROC curve for the average performance of random
classification is a line from (0,0) to (1,1).  The maximum ROC curve
(perfect classification) is (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,1).  The minimum ROC curve
(worst classification) is (0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1).  Points in ROC space can be
linearly interpolated.</p>

<p>A <strong>PR curve</strong> describes precision as a function of
recall across all thresholds.  Typical PR curves go from (0,y1) to
(1,y2) and are decreasing.  Better PR curves approach the point (1,1)
and have larger areas.  The PR curve for the average performance of
random classification is a line from (0,y2) to (1,y2).  The maximum PR
curve is (0,1)-(1,1)-(1,y2).  The minimum PR curve is a curve from (0,0)
to (1,y2).  Points in PR space <em>cannot</em> be linearly
interpolated.</p>

<p>The <strong>core idea</strong> of ROC/PR analysis is ranking the test
examples from most-positive to most-negative (according to some score)
and then comparing the ranking against the true labels.  A threshold can
be chosen between any two neighboring examples.  A threshold represents
a single, achievable classification accuracy: all the examples ranked
higher are classified positive and all the examples ranked lower are
classified negative.  (The classification according to the threshold is
compared to the true labels to determine accuracy.)  It is in this
manner that picking thresholds trades off classification
performance. Each threshold defines
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion
matrix</a> and hence a point in ROC/PR space.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>ROC and PR analysis centers around the class {@link
mloss.roc.CurveData}, which represents a ranking of the true labels from
most positive to most negative.  A ranking contains all the information
needed to construct ROC and PR curves.  Typically, a classifier assigns
a score to each test example.  The score reflects how positive the
classifier considers the example.  The test examples can then be ranked
from most positive to most negative and the true labels analyzed to
produce ROC and PR curves.</p>

<p>If you already have a ranking, you can construct a {@code CurveData}
directly using the {@link mloss.roc.CurveData#CurveData(List, Object)}
or {@link mloss.roc.CurveData#CurveData(int[])} constructors.
Typically, you will only have the output of the classifier and will want
to use one of the builders to construct the analysis.</p>

<p>Builders exist to give you an intuitive and user-friendly way to
construct rankings for ROC/PR analysis.  You provide a builder the
outputs of your classifier and the corresponding true labels, and it
computes the ranking and gives you back an analysis object ({@code
CurveData}).  Builders come in two flavors, one for collections ({@link
mloss.roc.CurveData.Builder}) and one for arrays of primitives ({@link
mloss.roc.CurveData.PrimitivesBuilder}).  (You can use the {@link
mloss.roc.util.IterableArray} class to treat arrays of objects as
iterable collections.)</p>

<p>Here is some example code to help you get started.</p>

<h2>Example Code</h2>

<pre><code>
// These are the true labels of your test set
int[] trueLabels = ...

// These are the predictions from your classifier that match,
// index-wise, the true labels
double[] scores = ...

// Create the analysis.  The ranking is computed automatically.
CurveData analysis = new CurveData.PrimitivesBuilder()
    .predicteds(scores)
    .actuals(trueLabels)
    .build();

// Calculate AUC ROC
double area = analysis.rocArea();

// Convex hull
CurveData hull = analysis.convexHull();
double maxArea = hull.rocArea();

// Points for plotting the curve
double[][] points = hull.rocPoints();
</code></pre>
