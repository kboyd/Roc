// TODO: handle case where classifier output is a weak ranking, e.g. class labels

/**
 * This class is a binary classification result analysis suitable for
 * producing ROC and PR curves.
 *
 * A binary (positive-negative) classifier assigns some number (score or
 * probability or class label) to each data point (example) in a data
 * set.  The assigned number reflects the classifier's belief that the
 * example is truly a positive example (as opposed to a negative
 * example).  Each example also has a true label, its class.  Therefore,
 * to test a classifier, one uses it to classify unseen examples (a test
 * set) and compares those classification results with the true labels.
 *
 * To classify new examples, one must first choose a threshold.  Then,
 * all the examples with scores higher than the threshold are classified
 * positive and all other examples are classified negative.  In
 * practice, considering only a single threshold is restrictive.  ROC
 * and PR curves consider performance at all possible thresholds.  To do
 * that, the scores are ranked from most-believed positive to
 * most-believed negative and then the list of true labels in the ranked
 * order is analyzed to produce ROC and PR curves.
 *
 * <h3>Technical Details</h3>
 *
 * Conceptually a ROC or PR curve is a list of confusion matrices, one
 * for each possible threshold of a ranking.  This representation
 * contains all the information needed to compute everything about ROC
 * and PR curves.  If you have n points in your ranking, you need n + 1
 * confusion matrices, one between each element of the ranking and one
 * on each of the ends.  A confusion matrix is a 2-by-2 table describing
 * the classification result that would occur if one chose the
 * classification threshold after the current element of the ranking.  A
 * confusion matrix contains four numbers: the number of true positives,
 * the number of false positives, the number of false negatives, and the
 * number of true negatives.  See the following table.
 *
 * <pre>
 *            |              Actual               |
 * Classified | Positive        | Negative        |
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Positive   | True Positive   | False Positive  |
 * Negative   | False Negative  | True Negative   |
 * ------------------------------------------------
 *            | Total Positives | Total Negatives |
 * </pre>
 *
 * Although each confusion matrix involves four numbers, each can
 * actually be represented by two numbers plus two totals (shared among
 * all matrices): the number of true positives so far in the ranking,
 * the number of false positives (negatives) so far in the ranking, the
 * total number of positives in the ranking, and the total number of
 * negatives in the ranking.  This is possible because the following
 * identities allow one to recover each confusion matrix.
 *
 * <code>
 * true positives = (true positive counts list)[ranking index]
 * false positives = (false positive counts list)[ranking index]
 * false negatives = (total positives) - (true positives)
 * true negatives = (total negatives) - (false positives)
 * </code>

         * might as well compute and report both (although for
         * efficiency one could just do subtraction, but that doesn't
         * matter much here).  The other reason for reporting both
         * statistics is that ROC area can be calculated using the U
         * statistic for the negative examples.  Thus we need to know
         * both statistics, or at least which is which, not just the
         * minimum one.
         *
         * The individual U statistics are not necessarily integers, so
         * we need to return a pair of doubles.
         *
         * The ranking of the labels has to be reconstructed from the
         * counts so that the U statistics can be calculated.  The
         * difference of confusion matrices gives the numbers of
         * positives and negatives between thresholds.  The sum of the
         * true/false positives in a confusion matrix gives the total
         * number of labels above a particular threshold which is also
         * the maximum rank for those labels.  In general, we need to
         * sum up the ranks for the positive and negative labels, but
         * tied labels get a fractional, mean rank.  The mean rank is
         * just the mean of all the "raw" ranks of the labels that are
         * tied.  So if labels with "raw" ranks of 2, 3, 4, 5 are tied
         * they each get a fractional rank of 3.5.  In order to
         * calculate the rank each label gets, we need to know the
         * minimum and maximum "raw" ranks of the group, or,
         * alternatively, the maximum "raw" rank and the numbers of
         * positives and negatives in the group.  (All labels in a group
         * are tied and correspond to a single confusion matrix.)  The
         * mean rank is calculated as (((min-raw-rank) + (max-raw-rank))
         * / 2).  The quantity (min-raw-rank) is the same as the
         * ((max-raw-rank) + 1) from the previous group/confusion matrix
         * and can therefore be calculated as ((max-raw-rank) -
         * (pos-count) - (neg-count) + 1).
         *
         * The formula for an individual U statistic is
         *
         * u = r - n * (n + 1) / 2
         *
         * where r is the sum of fractional ranks for the sample and n
         * is the sample size.  Relationships between the U statistics
         * of the two samples:
         *
         * N = n1 + n2
         * r1 + r2 = N * (N + 1) / 2
         * u1 + u2 = n1 * n2

     * Builds CurveData objects in multiple, flexible ways.  To build a
     * CurveData from primitives see {@link PrimitivesBuilder}.
     *
     * Fundamentally, a curve is built from a ranking of labels and a
     * label to consider positive (see {@link
     * CurveData#CurveData(List<T>, T)}).  However, curves are often
     * constructed from lists of predictions (scores) and the
     * corresponding actual labels.  In this case, the actual labels are
     * ranked by sorting the scores in descending order.
     *
     * Therefore, in order to build a curve one must provide (1) a
     * ranking of labels or (2) corresponding lists of predictions and
     * actual labels.  A positive label must also be provided.  A list
     * of weights may be given.  The list must correspond to the lists
     * of predicteds and actuals (if given) or correspond to the list of
     * ranked labels.  A comparator may be given which will be used for
     * sorting the scores.  Otherwise the natural ordering of the scores
     * will be used.
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>All inputs will be left unmodified.</li>
     * <li>Iterables will be instantiated as lists unless they are
     * already lists.</li>

     * all comparators are reversed internally.</li>
