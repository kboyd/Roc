All About Roc
=============


Description
-----------

Roc is software for generating and working with ROC ([Receiver Operating
Characteristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic))
and PR
([Precision-Recall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall))
curves.  These curves are typically used to evaluate classification
approaches in areas such as Machine Learning and Epidemiology.
Scientists and researchers are the target audience of this software.

The goal of this project is to provide software for evaluating ROC and
PR curves that correctly implements the traditional and recent
approaches using languages allowing for flexibility in each
investigator's environment.

Roc, the name of the software, is pronounced "rock" like its namesake,
roc, an [enormous, legendary bird of
prey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology\)).

Features and Project Maturity
-----------------------------

This software is in the early design and development stages.  It is
planned to be released as a library and as a command-line interface
(CLI) front-end for the library.  The table below contains a summary of
features.  Features are "not applicable", "planned", "implemented",
"tested", or "stable".
