Roc Project Goals, Ideals, and Philosophies
===========================================


General
-------

* Clarity. One should be able to easily grok the models and APIs.


Documentation
-------------

* Single- and multiple-page formats.  A single page is easily searchable
  and multiple pages are easily navigable (quick to load).

* Cookbook with tutorial examples.  Include example output and
  screenshots (which are important to show users).

* Have a FAQ but have it mainly serve as a sort of index to the
  documentation.  Deal with the question briefly in the FAQ and link to
  the appropriate documentation.  Improve documentation so that it is
  always the main, correct source.

* Document what does not exist almost as much as what does.  This
  includes deficiencies, planned features, out of scope, etc.


Features
--------

* Make simple things easy and difficult things possible

* One-button solution

* Flexible, multi-depth API so that people can go from the one-button
  solution to the gritty details and anywhere in between.

* Accomodate any reasonable anticipated use
